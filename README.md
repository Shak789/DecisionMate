## Overview

Being a first-year student in UTSC CMS programs is already difficult enough. Students are transitioning from high school, dealing with heavier workloads and learning challenging concepts in their courses. It can even be more stressful for students to determine if they have qualified for POSt.
Therefore, I developed DecisionMate, which is designed to assist UTSC CMS students in determining their eligibility for POSt. The app provides a user-friendly interface where students answer simple questions to determine if they are eligible for various CMS programs. They can also input thier marks to check if they meet grade requirements for differents program.
